I am currently the DeepMind Academic Fellow in Machine Learning in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Queen Mary University of London and an Associate Professor in Actuarial Science at the University of Witwatersrand. I completed my PhD at the University of Johannesburg under the supervision of Professor [Tshilidzi Marwala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tshilidzi_Marwala) and Dr [Ilyes Boulkaibet](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=Syy1V1AAAAAJ&hl=en). I was a recipient of the 2019 Google Africa PhD fellowship, which supported my PhD work in Bayesian Neural Networks. 

I am a fellow of the Actuarial Society of South Africa and a holder of the Chartered Enterprise Risk Actuary designation.
